# E-commerce Frontend (React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)

This is the frontend for the e-commerce mobile application, built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create `.env` file:**
    Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. Update the `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` if your backend is running on a different address.
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Technologies Used

*   React.js
*   TypeScript
*   Tailwind CSS
*   React Router (can be added later for navigation)
*   Axios (can be added later for API calls)
